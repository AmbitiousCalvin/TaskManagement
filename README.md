# Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a simple to-do list app, currently in its early stages. The goal is to build a functional and expandable application, but for now, it's just a basic start.

## Technologies Used
- **React**
- **SASS**

## Features
1. **Basic To-Do List**: 
   - The app currently allows users to add, remove, and edit tasks, keeping it simple and functional.

## Future Plans
- Might come back to this when I am more competent
  
## Result of this project.
I started this project to practice CRUD operations. It was tough at times and I made a lot of mistakes such as (unnecessary states, effects mutations, etc...), but Iâ€™ve learned a lot and look forward to improving as I build more.
Also, this project pushed me to read the react docs which I should have done a lot sonner.
